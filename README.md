# Sample MCQs for any SMIT Course Entry Test

The questions are very easy if your test is online or onsite in both cases smit will give you easy questions because of Saylani's Impressive Vision. 

**These are sample SMIT questions that appeared when I took the Graphic Design and other courses test. They are almost the same as the questions from the previous SMIT Entry test (that I gave online).**

*Remember, a student cannot enroll in more than one program if they are already studying in another program. You can only enroll in a new program if you have completed the previously enrolled course.*
